Crisis And Relief Engagement, C.A.R.E., is a web application designed to inform natural disaster survivors of available aid and resources in a given location. It utilizes the real-time aspect of Twitter to instantaneously track information regarding a specific natural disaster as it becomes available. C.A.R.E. also functions as a case study for one of New York Cityâ€™s biggest natural disasters: Hurricane Sandy. The Google API, Twitter API, and D3.js are all used in tandem with the goal to help natural disaster survivors find immediate resources within the time period of Hurricane Sandy.
